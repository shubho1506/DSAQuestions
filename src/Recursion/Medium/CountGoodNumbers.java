//A digit string is good if the digits (0-indexed) at even indices are even and the digits at
// odd indices are prime (2, 3, 5, or 7).
//For example, "2582" is good because the digits (2 and 8) at even positions are even and the digits (5 and 2)
// at odd positions are prime. However, "3245" is not good because 3 is at an even index but is not even.
//Given an integer n, return the total number of good digit strings of length n. Since the answer may be large,
// return it modulo 109 + 7.
//A digit string is a string consisting of digits 0 through 9 that may contain leading zeros.

//Example 1:
//Input: n = 1
//Output: 5
//Explanation: The good numbers of length 1 are "0", "2", "4", "6", "8".

//Example 2:
//Input: n = 4
//Output: 400

//Example 3:
//Input: n = 50
//Output: 564908303
