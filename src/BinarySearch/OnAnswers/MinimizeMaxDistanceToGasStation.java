//We have a horizontal number line. On that number line, we have gas stations at positions
// stations[0], stations[1], ..., stations[n-1], where n is the size of the stations array.
// Now, we add k more gas stations so that d, the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations,is minimized.
// We have to find the smallest possible value of d. Find the answer exactly to 2 decimal places.
//Note: stations is in a strictly increasing order.

//Example 1:
//Input:
//n = 10
//stations[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
//k = 9
//Output: 0.50
//Explanation: Each of the 9 stations can be added mid way between all the existing adjacent stations.

//Example 2:
//Input:
//n = 10
//stations[] = [3, 6, 12, 19, 33, 44, 67, 72, 89, 95]
//k = 2
//Output: 14.00
//Explanation: Construction of gas stations at 8th(between 72 and 89) and 6th(between 44 and 67) locations.
